1. When processing task like task6, I met some data quality issue like there are symbol double quotes in the items which will cause the program to get wrong data 
   while splitting data according to comma because there are comma between the double quotes.
   For example:
   7009899708,2016-03-24,64,NY,"64-No STD Ex Con/DPL, D/S Dec",19,19,0122P,,,361349,T103,19,T,GFCHEF,SRF,NY,Park Ave,SUBN,BK,FORD,2014

2. In some other tasks like task8, there are some items got is None, after comparing the result via script provided, these datas should be processed.
